## Config rules
This project uses 
- node `v20.14.0`
- Formatter: prettier config with tw [plugin](https://tailwindcss.com/blog/automatic-class-sorting-with-prettier) (read about the default prettier options [here](https://prettier.io/docs/en/options))
- Linter: eslint config
- EOL: LF (line feed)
- Indentation: spaces (2)
- Pre-commit hook: NA for now 


Others
- Setup format on save in your editor settings
- Get ESLint extension by msoft
- I've also added a format script run `npm run format` to format all tsx/jsx code, good for bulk formatting




Make sure to set this up before working on the project.

To test if your setup is identical, try formatting an unchanged file in your editor, git diff shouldn't detect any changes.
